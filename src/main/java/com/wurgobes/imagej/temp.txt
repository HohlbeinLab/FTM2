/* Fast Temporal Median filter
(c) 2017 Rolf Harkes and Bram van den Broek, Netherlands Cancer Institute.
Based on the Fast Temporal Median Filter for ImageJ by the Milstein Lab.
It implementes the T.S.Huang algorithm in a maven .jar for easy deployment in Fiji (ImageJ2)
Calculating the median from the ranked data, and processing each pixel in parallel.
The filter is intended for pre-processing of single molecule localization data.
v2.3

/* Median finding histogram
(c) 2019 Rolf Harkes, Netherlands Cancer Institute.
Based on the Fast Temporal Median Filter for ImageJ by the Milstein Lab.
This class would run on every pixel in an image and is therefore kept minimal.
The medianFindingHistogram is created once and then updated with new values.

Known limitations for increased speed
* only odd windows where the median is the center value

Known limitations due to usage of the short datatype:
* no more than 32767 unique values allowed (a SMLM experiment would usually have about 1000 unique values)
* no more than 32767 equal values allowed  (the window is usually 501)
